# web-dev-project

# About the project
This is a multiplayer chess game made for Dawson's college web development class. It was made by Guilherme CorrÃªa and Noah Labrecque in approxematly 30 days.  
Our goal for this project was to challenge ourselves in learning key concepts in networking and javascript.  
Because of certificate issues we aren't able to make our website interactive on our sonic acount, but you can try it out on this ip -> 70.26.238.78:8000.
